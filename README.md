# Innopolis Thesis Template

This is a full *LaTeX* template for your thesis work. It can be imported to Overleaf or used offline.

## Configuring VS Code and installing LaTeX

Install the [LaTeX Workshop extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)
in VS Code and [Tex Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (full-scheme, smaller ones don't work right out of the box) on your system.
The rest should be configured already in the repo.


## How to replace the title page with the real one

1. Open `docx` template (folder `title/<your department or bach if bachelor student>.docx`).
2. Enter the **thesis title, supervisor's and your name** in appropriate places in both English and Russian languages.
3. Enter current year (last row).
4. Convert the file to `title.pdf`, replace the existing one in the root folder.
