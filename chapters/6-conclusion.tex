\section{Summary}

We have designed and implemented an initial prototype of the language server
and VS Code extension for an experimental proof assistant \Rzk{}.
An intermediate result of this work has been presented at the
\textit{Interactions of Proof Assistants and Mathematics}\footnote{\url{https://itp-school-2023.github.io/}}
school in Germany in September of 2023.
This has helped gather feedback from the users and react to it on the spot.
We feel that current users are mostly satisfied with the prototype tooling,
but have also provided useful suggestions for further improvements.

\section{Future work}

The current implementation of the language server for \Rzk{} is still in its early stages.
There are many features that are still missing, as well as areas for improvement.
For example, a proper customer satisfaction survey should be conducted for a formal
evaluation of the effectiveness of the product of this work.
This would help identify the most important features to work on next.

In the future, we plan to support displaying variable information on hover,
jumping to definition, renaming symbols, and other useful LSP features.
Eventually, we also plan to support rendering topes as images,
and adding an information WebView similar to the one provided by Lean 4 \cite{Nawrocki2023}.

It is also anticipated that a Haskell library for developing language servers
(especially for proof assistants) can grow out of this project.
